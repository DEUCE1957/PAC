    "When a source of sound is moving toward an observer, the frequency of that sound is higher, and when a source of sound is moving away from an observer its frequency is lower. This is quite a common experience, for instance you may notice it with a passing firetruck and its blaring sirens.\n",
    "\n",
    "To wrap your head around this, think of one of the knights who say \"Ni\" and have them be at rest emitting sound at a constant frequency and in all directions. The velocity of the resulting wave will only depend on the medium it is travelling in. If the knight starts running though, in front of the knight they will be 'catching up' to the wave crests and so an observer in front of the source will observe more wave crests passing per second (a higher frequency). Conversely, an observer behind the knight the spacing between wave crests is larger than normal and so the frequency is lower. (Drawings definitely help here)"

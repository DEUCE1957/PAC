    "# Propagation of Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with uncertainties based on a large collection of numbers the manipulation of measured quantities and the error associated with each quantity will contribute to the error in the final answer. The following formulae are a good approximation of the error and become increasingly accurate as the number of measurements increases or when the cross terms between the contributing errors are reasonably small. If you are unsure how to deal with these, **remember that you have learned about this in the Mathematical Techniques lectures** and refer to your notes from that lecture course. See also the textbook *Measurements and their Uncertainties*, chapter 4.2.\n",

    "# If Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "An `if` statement is the most basic programming conditional and is used to execute one set of codes if a logical expression evaluates to `True` and a different set of code otherwise:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  if (conditional statement):\n",
    "    (indented commands to run when True)\n",
    "    \n",
    "  (non-indented commands are no longer part of the statement)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the logical expression is `True` then Python will execute all lines after the colon that are indented - it's very important to note that Python needs you to use the correct indenting.\n",
    "When Python sees a non-indented line it will leave the 'if environment' and resume normal service.\n",
    "If the logical expression is `False` , Python will skip the commands between the colon and the next non-indented line.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The if command can be extended by incorporating the commands `else` and `elif` (else if), allowing you to specify a number of results depending on the outcomes of more refined testing conditions (see the example below).\n",
    "The `elif` statement is accompanied by a logical condition which is only evaluated if the preceding `if` and `elif` statements are `False`, i.e. `conditional statement B` will only be evaluated if `conditional statement A` is `False`.\n",
    "The `else` statement is the catch-all that is executed if all previous conditions have evaluated to `False`.\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "if (conditional statement A):\n",
    "    (indented commands to run when statement A True)\n",
    "elif (conditional statement B):\n",
    "    (indented commands to run when statement A False / statement B True)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    (indented commands to run when both statements are False)\n",
    "\n",
    "(non-indented commands are no longer part of the statement)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a structure like the above, **one and only one** of the possible branches will be executed -- which one is executed will depend on the condition statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example executes various tests on the parameter `a` and depending on the tests, performs different operations on `a`.  At the same time it assigns values $0$, $1$ and $2$ to a further parameter `j`: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = np.exp(1)  # assign value to a\n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "if a<=1:  # if a is smaller or equal to 1, multiply it by 2\n",
    "    a = 2*a\n",
    "    j=0\n",
    "elif 1<a<3:  # if a is between 1 and 3, subtract 1\n",
    "    a = a - 1\n",
    "    j=1\n",
    "else:  # in any other case, divide by 2\n",

    "    j=2\n",

    "Typically, `if` commands are used within a loop or function where the variable to be tested could be changing its value.\n",

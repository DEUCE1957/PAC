    "Functions are similar to cells except they can be called from anywhere else in the notebook and often accept **input arguments** and `return` **output arguments**.\n",
    "You've already explored many built-in examples of functons, e.g. the `np.sin()` function, which takes one input argument (an angle in radians) and returns one output argument (the sine of that angle).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each notebook can only see certain functions: a) functions core to Python, e.g. `print()`; b) functions imported into the notebook, i.e. `import numpy as np` means the notebook can see all NumPy functions; and c) functions defined within the notebook itself (as we will shortly do).\n",
    "This means that if you define a custom function in one notebook, a separate notebook will not know that function (unless you also define it in the new notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `total` function defined below, for example, is a simple Python function that calculates the sum of the elements of a 1D array:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def total(x):  # def allows us to DEFine a new function called total that takes one input 'x'\n",
    "    ''' TOTAL - sum of all elements in 1D array x \n",
    "        This function works for row and column vectors of any length.\n",
    "        Here we have chosen the output argument to be s,\n",
    "        but you can change that to whatever you like.'''\n",
    "\n",
    "    s=0  # initialise our sum variable\n",
    "    for i in np.arange(x.size):\n",
    "        s = s + x[i]\n",

    "# The next lines are not inside the function so cannot see anything from within the function\n",
    "myArray = np.random.rand(10,1)  # create a 10 item 1D array of random values\n",

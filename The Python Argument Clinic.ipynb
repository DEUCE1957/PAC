    "Python is a powerful programming language that is the standard in Data Visualisation in both industry and academia. It values readability, using indentation to set how code is run. This indentation of different parts of the code means you can tell roughly how a program works in a single glance. Due to its many conveniences, it's also a go-to for quickly wacking together a working programme and so is often used for personal projects.  \n",

    "Under the hood, programming is just a manipulation of 1s and 0s inside a computer. These 1s and 0s are used to represent numbers, text and a whole lot more. In Python these representations are known as data types. You can do a whole bunch of standard operations with these data types (see [operators](#operators) ). \n",
    "\n",
    "These data types are split into two categories: **primitives** which are the simplest data type and cannot be split up further and **composites** which act as containers for primitive values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primitives\n",
    "The main primitive values in Python are:\n",
    "    * Integers such as 5, -3, etc. \n",
    "    * Floats (a number with decimal places) such as 2.5 or 3.14159265 \n",
    "    * Strings which are pieces of text like \"sasquatch\" \n",
    "    * Booleans which can be either True or False\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Composites\n",
    "Composites are useful containers for primitive values that allow us to do operations on them more conveniently, we will cover a few of these in this section:\n",
    "    * Lists, which is a collection of items\n",
    "    * Dictionaries which map keys to values. These are like real-life dictionaries where a word (the key) maps to a description (the value) \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Checking Types\n",
    "If you are ever confused what type something has, you can use Python's in-built **type()** function. This will give you the type of whatever you put in the brackets. For example\n",
    "\n",
    "    type(6) \n",
    "    \n",
    "Will tell you that 6 is an int (i.e. an integer)\n",

    "    * Various numeric types like int (an integer) and floats (a number with decimal places), but you don’t need to worry about the details now\n",
    "    * String represents pieces of text\n",
    "    * Boolean represents values of True or False\n",
    "    * List represents any ordered collection of items\n",
    "    * Dictionaries map keys to values, they are like real-life dictionaries where a word (the key) maps to a description (the value) \n",
    "To make our lives easier, we might want to refer to the same object many times in a program. **Variables** allow you to do this.\n",
    "We define variables by simply giving them a name and a value, like this:  \n",
    "    * x = 12\n",
    "    * eventName = “the Python Argument Clinic\"\n",
    "    * y = 2.5\n",
    "    * z = x + y\n",
    "    * message = “I am attending” + eventName  \n",
    "\n",
    "This way of associating a value with an identifier is called **assignment**  \n",
    "and it uses the assignment operator `=`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the right side of the assignment operator can be any kind of expression.  \n",
    "An expression will always evaluate to a particular data type.\n",

    "Note 1:\n",

    "The way Python handles variables is somewhat idiosyncratic. When you do something like the below,\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Python will simply use the name 'x' to point to an integer object somewhere in memory. In fact, all variables pointing to 2 will point to the same object. In the case of integers it makes no difference to us, however we will see this can cause trouble when you start assigning assigning more complex data types as variables. \n",

    "<a href = #begin style = \"color:purple\"> > Jump to Begginer Section Content Table \\< </a>  \n",
    "Python is equipped with a number of standard operators, which we will briefly go through here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Plus Operator : **+**  \n",
    "The plus operator is used for adding two values together:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    four = 1 + 3 #Assigns the value 4 to the variable 'four'\n",
    "    grav = 0.81 + 9 #Addition evaluates to 9.81, which is then assigned to the variable 'grav'\n",
    "    \n",
    "It can also be used to concatenate two strings\n",
    "\n",
    "    spam = \"SPAM\" + \" SPAM\" + \" SPAM\" + \" SPAM\" + \" WONDERFUL SPAM\" \n",
    "    #Assigns \"SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM WONDERFUL SPAM\" to the variable spam\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that you cannot add a number value to a string, the following operation is illegal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    breakPython = \"SPAM\" + 42\n",
    "    \n",
    "To do this you either first need to convert the integer to 42:\n",
    "\n",
    "    savePython = \"SPAM\" + str(42)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Or you can use something called Interpolation, which is covered in the printing section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Minus Operator : **-**  \n",
    "The minus operator is used for subtracting one value from another:\n",
    "\n",
    "    margin = 0.519 - 0.491 # Evaluates to 0.028, which is assigned to the variable margin\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### The Multiplication Operator : **\\***  \n",
    "The multiplication operator multiplies two values:\n",
    "\n",
    "    howDoYourMeasureAYearInTheLife = 365 * 24 * 60 # Evaluates to 525,600 minutes\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### The Exponentiation Operator : **\\*\\***  \n",
    "The exponentiation operator raises a value to a power:\n",
    "\n",
    "    buzzLightSecond = ( 3 * 10**8 ) # Evaluates to 3x10^8 m\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### The Modulo Operator : **%**  \n",
    "The modulo operator gives the remainder when diving one value by another:\n",
    "\n",
    "    even = 5 % 2 #Evaluates to 1, which suggests the first number is not even\n",
    "    factor = 12 % 4 #Evaluates to 0, which means we can use modulo to check if a number is a factor of another\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### The Floor Division Operator : **//**  \n",
    "The floor division operator will divide one number by another and round down the result to an integer value\n",
    "\n",
    "    you = 5/2 # NORMAL DIVISION : evaluates to 2.5\n",
    "    just = 5//2 #evaluates to 2 \n",
    "    got = -11//3 #evaluates to -4 (always rounds down!)\n",
    "    floored = -11.2//3.8 #Evaluates to -4.0 (will first do normal division, then rounds down)\n",
    "    kid = -9.0//3 #Evaluates to -3.0 (if one or both of the numbers the result will be a decimal too\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr> \n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Operators  \n",
    "Logic is all about making decisions. In order to make a decision, you first need a way of answering questions - called conditional statements. In Python these answers are stored as Booleans to represent True or False outcomes, which is analagous to a yes or no answer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  We can write expressions that evaluate to a Boolean and then use Logical Operators to make smart decisions based on more than 1 conditions. Logical Operators thus allow us to combine many conditional statements to control what action our program will take next!\n",
    "  \n",
    "Note that in these examples we evaluate a logical expression and assign this to a variable, like so:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    variableName = <SOME EXPRESSION>\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to put anything to the right of an asignment (denoted by a single = sign) so long as it evaluates to a data type.\n",
    "  \n",
    "####  **==**  \n",
    "The equality operator checks if two values are the same\n",
    "\n",
    "    letThisFloat = 6.0 == 6 \n",
    "    #Evaluates to True, since 6.0 (a float) has the same value as 6 (an integer)\n",
    "    wontLetThisFloat = 6.5 == 6\n",
    "    #Evaluates to False, since 6.5 (a float) has a different value than 6 (an integer)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **!=**  \n",
    "The inequality operator check if two values are not the same\n",
    "    \n",
    "    palindrome = \"bolton\" != \"ipswitch\"\n",
    "    #Evaluates to True since \"bolton\" is not the same as \"ipswitch\"\n",
    "    volts = 3000 != 3000.0 \n",
    "    #Evaluates to False since 3000 has the same value as 3000.0\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### **> < >= <=**  \n",
    "The inequality logical operators check if two values satisfy an inequality\n",

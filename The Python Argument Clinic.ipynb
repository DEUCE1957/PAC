    "Python is a powerful programming language that is the standard in Data Visualisation in both industry and academia. It values readability, using indentation to set how code is run. This indentation of different parts of the code means you can tell roughly how a program works in a single glance. Due to its many conveniences, it's also a go-to for quickly wacking together a working programme and so is often used for personal projects.  \n",

    "\n",
    "You can print pretty much any expression in Python, and we’ll be using it extensively during the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a name=\"types\">Types </a>\n",
    "Under the hood, programming is just a manipulation of 1s and 0s inside a computer. These 1s and 0s are used to represent numbers, text and a whole lot more. In Python these representations are known as data types. You can do a whole bunch of standard operations with these data types (see [operators](#operators) ). \n",
    "\n",
    "These data types are split into two categories: **primitives** which are the simplest data type and cannot be split up further and **composites** which act as containers for primitive values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primitives\n",
    "The main primitive values in Python are:\n",
    "    * Integers such as 5, -3, etc. \n",
    "    * Floats (a number with decimal places) such as 2.5 or 3.14159265 \n",
    "    * Strings which are pieces of text like \"sasquatch\" \n",
    "    * Booleans which can be either True or False\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Composites\n",
    "Composites are useful containers for primitive values that allow us to do operations on them more conveniently, we will cover a few of these in this section:\n",
    "    * Lists, which is an ordered collection of items\n",
    "    * Dictionaries which map keys to values. These are like real-life dictionaries where a word (the key) maps to a description (the value) \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Dynamic Typing\n",
    "Python is a Dynamically typed language, this means you do NOT have to explicitly say what data type are a variable is. We'll go into this some more in the next part :) !\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a name=\"exprNvars\">Expression and Variables </a>\n",
    "An expression in Python is essentially the building block of your program.  \n",
    "Anything that you can manipulate and use is an expression. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"-webkit-column-count: 2; -moz-column-count: 2; column-count: 2; -webkit-column-rule: 1px dotted #e0e0e0; -moz-column-rule: 1px dotted #e0e0e0; column-rule: 1px dotted #e0e0e0;\">\n",

    "An **Expression** has a particular data type. The main data types in Python are:\n",
    "    * Various numeric types like int (an integer) and floats (a number with decimal places), but you don’t need to worry about the details now\n",
    "    * String represents pieces of text\n",
    "    * Boolean represents values of True or False\n",
    "    * List represents any ordered collection of items\n",
    "    * Dictionaries map keys to values, they are like real-life dictionaries where a word (the key) maps to a description (the value) \n",
    "To make our lives easier, we might want to refer to the same object many times in a program. **Variables** allow you to do this.\n",
    "We define variables by simply giving them a name and a value, like this:  \n",
    "    * x = 12\n",
    "    * eventName = “the Python Argument Clinic\"\n",
    "    * y = 2.5\n",
    "    * z = x + y\n",
    "    * message = “I am attending” + eventName  \n",
    "\n",
    "This way of associating a value with an identifier is called **assignment**  \n",
    "and it uses the assignment operator `=`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the right side of the assignment operator can be any kind of expression.  \n",
    "An expression will always evaluate to a particular data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "The way Python handles variables is somewhat idiosyncratic. When you do something like the below,\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Python will simply use the name 'x' to point to an integer object somewhere in memory. In fact, all variables pointing to 2 will point to the same object. In the case of integers it makes no difference to us, however we will see this can cause trouble when you start assigning assigning more complex data types as variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a name=\"operators\">Operators</a>\n",
    "Python is equipped with a number of standard operators, which we will briefly go through here.\n",
    "\n",

    "The plus operator is used for adding two values together:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    four = 1 + 3 #Assigns the value 4 to the variable 'four'\n",
    "    grav = 0.81 + 9 #Addition evaluates to 9.81, which is then assigned to the variable 'grav'\n",

    "    #Assigns \"SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM WONDERFUL SPAM\" to the variable spam\n",

    "\n",
    "    breakPython = \"SPAM\" + 42\n",
    "    \n",
    "To do this you either first need to convert the integer to 42:\n",

    "1. We start off with an **x** set to **0** which we use as our counter.  \n",
    "2. We then start the while loop.   \n",
    "3. The condition is **x < 10** which means that the while loop will run until this condition  \n",
    "is no longer satisfied. \n",
    "4. At the start **x** is obviously less than **10** so the loop runs and we see the statement printing.    \n",
    "5. We then run **x = x + 1** , which simply adds **1** to **x** , since **x** was **0** before it now becomes **1**.  \n",
    "This is the end of the code block and the loop restarts, checking **x** yet again.  \n",
    "6. It is now **1** which is still less than **10** so the loop runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This keeps going until after the statement prints **10** times, the value of **x** is now **10**  \n",
    "and we move on from the while loop.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Breaking from a loop</u>   \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want to force exit from a loop without going back to the initial  \n",
    "condition. We can do this using the **break** keyword. This will cause the loop to  \n",
    "immediately stop and move on. Consider this program for instance:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    x = 0\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        if x == 5:\n",
    "            break\n",
    "        print(“The value of x is ” + x)\n",
    "        x = x + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, notice the use of True as a condition. This means that the loop will  \n",
    "essentially run forever, or at least until a break happens. This loop checks x, prints out  \n",
    "x and increases x every iteration. However, as soon as x is equal to 5, it will break and  \n",
    "exit. Writing loops like can be very useful in some situations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### <a name=\"list\">Lists</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are an important data type which allow you to represent **collections of items**.  The items in a list can be of any type.\n",
    "For example, say you want to keep track of the names of employees in a company,  \n",
    "in Python it would look like this:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    employees = [“John Smith”, “Mona Simpson”, “Robert Blake”, “Fiona\n",
    "    Clarkson”]\n",
    "    \n",
    "There are some operations we should be familiar with regarding lists. You can  \n",
    "access elements in a list by using an index . The **index** is specified inside square  \n",
    "brackets after the list variable’s name. Lists are indexed starting 0, which means that  \n",
    "the first element is really zeroth element. For instance the first employee in the above  \n",
    "example would be given by:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    employees[0]\n",
    "    \n",
    "Go ahead and try this! Try accessing other employees as well and printing them.  \n",
    "Now say you need to add a new employee to your list. We use the **append()** function  \n",
    "to do this.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    employees.append(“Richard Hendricks”)\n",
    "    \n",
    "But we can also do this: `employees = employees + “Richard Hendricks”` as an  \n",
    "alternative way to add elements to lists.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We may at times need to get the length of a list. We can do this using the **len()**  \n",
    "function:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    len(employees)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly we might want to remove items from a list, which we can do using the  \n",
    "**remove()** method:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    employees.remove(“John Smith”)\n",
    "    \n",
    "### <a name=\"for\">For Loop</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "**For loops** are another type of loop which are quite useful when dealing with **lists**. It  \n",
    "allows us to easily go over items in a list and do something with them. They are used  \n",
    "like this:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    for <item> in <collection to go over>:\n",
    "        <do something for each item>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Take for example the employees list we made above. Say we would like to print out  \n",
    "all the employee names in list. We can do this like so:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    for employee in employees:\n",
    "        print(“This employee’s name is ” + employee)\n",
    "    \n",
    "This goes through the employee list and executes the print statement appropriately.  \n",
    "Notice that there’s another variable that we refer to inside the for loop, employee. We  \n",
    "define the name of this variable in the first line of the for loop and it essentially acts  \n",
    "as pointer to the current employee for which the code is currently running. This is  \n",
    "best understood with examples, so do follow along.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### <a name=\"dict\">Dictionaries</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are one of the most important data structures in Python. They map <b>keys</b> to <b>values</b>; in other languages dictionaries are often called maps or hash maps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Values can be any type, but keys must be hashable. We won't get into what this means more deeply, but in practice it means that you can only use immutable types like integers, strings or tuples as keys. You could not assign a list to be a key, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "There can only be one value per key, however, you can use compound data structures to effectively get around this restriction. A particularly useful case is the nested dictionary, where keys are mapped to dictionaries containing their own entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can construct a dictionary that maps student names to their grades like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "student_dict = {\"Example Exampleson\" : \"A4\", \"Monty Python\" : \"B3\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries enable extremely efficient item lookup. The standard syntax for performing lookups is dictname[key].\n",
    "\n",
    "student_dict[\"Example Exampleson\"] would evaluate to \"A4\".\n",

# Python Argument Clinic (PAC)

## Problem Space
### Attrition
Lower attendance as sessions progress.

**Solutions**:
* Automate Marketing - setup mailing lists for relevant departments and their individual class heads. Then send out message every week or **fortnightly**.
  * Facebook: Have them share post
  * Email: Single Image Advert with Link (Keep it Simple)
  * Departments:
    * English Language/Linguistics(PHD only?)
    * Archeology(Phd only?)
    * Psychology(Phd only?)
    * Economics(?)
    * Buisness(?)
  * Use GlasKnow
  * **Fuse** - Institute of Affiliated Physics Societies. New tiered system requires skills-based activities, i.e. pull resources for Workshops. (Loughborough, Hull)
* More Posters, beyond the Kelvin Building (e.g. Food for Thought, Brasserie, Engineering...)
* Collaborate more actively with other societies
  *  Robotics Society and Raspberry Pi or Arduino (Special Workshop)
     *  Provide Skeleton Code
     *  Pedro? 
  *  GUTS and Machine Learning 
     *  Mutual Advertisement
  *  GUorbit and Deep Learning
  *  EngSoc, FemEng
  *  Woman in Physics (all Physicist) - might be double advertisement
* Change poster designs (semi-dramatically)  

### Silence
Few people are confident enough to actively ask for help

**Solutions**:
* Proactively ask if attendees need help
  * Continue by instinct
* Add reminders in notebook at the end of each subsection
  * Link to **Discord server** for online (includes a written record)
* Work in Groups/Pairs 3-4 people
  * Rationale: Spokespeople are less shy
  * Match-up: 
    * Formal: Tweak sign-up sheet for grouping
    * Informal: Tutors direct them together, still allows for individual work
  * Groups at roughly same level
    * Simple Questions at end of Beginner Section
    * Group rapporte 
  * Facilitate ice breaker at start
* Hush the tutors (whispher only)

### Lecture Line-Up
People would like a lecture series (feedback very good), but the sporadic presence of attendees makes it dificult to do this holistically.

**Solutions**:
* Record the lectures (no lecture recording present)
  * Lectures at lunch time (may be difficult to book)
  * Reading Room is available (max capacity: 20)
  * Labs are free (mac capacity: >20)
  * Acre Road observatory for Astronomy students (might be too much on one day)
  * 222/257 must go through central booking
  * Does not disadvantage home students
* Have tiered lectures corresponding to each of the sections

### Timing
Hard to engage people after 5pm

**Solutions**:
* Trial Lunch Runs (split excess tutors)
  * Not enough time for session but do have enough time for lectures
* Provide refreshements (tea/biscuits) in the hallway OUTSIDE OF THE LAB
  * **ToDo**: Ask Martin Hendry nicely (ourselves), CC Graham)
  * Don't do it through central services (expensive!)
  * Get cheap bourbon creams (no one will know)
  
### Gathering Feedback
Currently have no way of gathering feedback.

Need a reliable way to measure how many people attended and ideally (GDPR allowing) who attended so we can gather feedback from them.

**Solutions**:
* Guest Book for feedback (semi-anonymous)
* Suggestions Box (anonymous)
* Headcount for metrics
* Count access to PAC notebook via Jupyter Hub (count copies of write-only jupyter notebook)
  
### Placement
Students prior knowledge of Python may vary considerally, how can we help account for this?

**Solution**:
* Make the existing placement quiz the initial focus
  * Make difficulty visible via Jupyter Notebook styling script
  * Change placement quiz to flowchart image (at a glance)
* Provide model solutions, for people to review their response (how accessible should this be?)
  * Ask John for model intermediate solutions
* Integrate NBgrader (Norman Gray) to validate responses and potentially show model solutions (also gives us metrics!)
  * Make this something you can toggle if it is too intimidating
* Add more quick-tasks as you go along, to prevent information overload
  
### Remote Access
Since there are so many exercises, remote access can help those who are motivated to try out more. Juypter Hub does not currently allow this without a technically-complicated VPN.

**Solutions**:
* Switch to Google CoLab (or as supplement?)
  *  Benefit: Remote Access. can drag-and-drop to your colab 
  *  Drawback: IDE might be more confusing environment?
  *  Need Google Account?
* Checkout Jupyter Lab (timeline?)
  * Benefit:Familiarity 
* Checkout Microsoft Azure Notebooks (limited credits?), setup custom virtual machines
  * Benefit: Everyone has an account already

### Freeloaders
Should we help those who come for Python-assistance rather than the workshops? Should we be doing their work for them?

**Solutions**:
* Moral Question
* Only rubber duck nudging (provide guidance)

## Lecture Series

**Individual Lectures**:
* **Erlend**: Basics of Computing
* **Xavier**: More of the Basics
* **Darius**: How to avoid for loops (Intermediate)
* **Kristina**: Numerical Methods - Topic of Choice (Intermediate)
  * Mesh Grid
  * Monte Carlo (infer pi): Slice of Pi 
* **Jeb**: Relativity Exercise (Advanced)
* More ideas?

## Experiments

**Hands-on Learning**: Have participants program a raspberry pi so they can get physical feedback for what they can do using programming (provide skeleton code to deal with overhead)

**Beginner Tutor**: Have someone who knows very little python/only just started learning write some of the beginner exercises


**For Feedback now**: Post quick survey on Facebook Page and message those whom we know personally.
